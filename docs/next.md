The current implementation includes:
Complete placement phase
Basic win condition checking
Simple computer AI
File operations for saving/loading game state
Clear board display
What's missing and needs to be implemented next:
Movement phase logic
More sophisticated computer AI
Additional error handling
More detailed game messages
Would you like me to:
Implement the movement phase next?
Enhance the computer AI?
Add more error handling?
Something else?
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed with the implementation.
